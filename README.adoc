== NOAA implementation of the pairwise method of Menne and Williams (2009), v52d layout

This repository is the v52d code/data layout aligned to a modernized project structure:

- `phav52d/` for source, scripts, and documentation
- `data/` for benchmark and real-world inputs/outputs

For detailed operational notes, see `phav52d/readme.quick_start`.

=== Inferred documentation

From `phav52d/scripts/combo_runs/case7_bench.sh`, the benchmark script accepts:

. `$1`: UCP routine stem, e.g. `UCPM24aM21fC6bL1Si6cR5aH1`

The script internally runs `${1}.FAST.MLY.21_21` against the case7 benchmark data.

=== Building and Running

Build with docker:

[source,shell]
----
$ docker build --tag noaa-pha:v52d .
----

The image compiles:

- PHA v52d (`UCPM24aM21fC6bL1Si6cR5aH1.FAST.MLY.21_21`)

`phav52d/documentation/readme.compiles` (distance/correlation/fillin helper utilities) is not run in Docker build because those legacy sources require a `g77`-compatible compiler.

Run the benchmark (bind-mount output so logs are persisted locally):

[source,shell]
----
$ docker run --rm -ti \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/benchmark/case7/output:/home/cwilliam/data/benchmark/case7/output" \
  noaa-pha:v52d \
  sh -c 'export USHCNBASE=$HOME && ./phav52d/scripts/combo_runs/case7_bench.sh UCPM24aM21fC6bL1Si6cR5aH1'
----

Benchmark logs are written to `data/benchmark/case7/output/case7_bench.<timestamp>.log`.
